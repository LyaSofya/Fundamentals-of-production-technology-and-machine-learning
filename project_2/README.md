# Project Title: Physical Activity Data Analysis

## Overview 
This project is divided into two main parts: **Physical Activity Recognition** and **Physical Activity Data Analysis with Neural Networks**. Additionally, the second part includes a task that utilizes a landscape dataset with AutoKeras and a pre-trained model to predict the type of terrain based on images, which can be useful for determining the locations of various physical activities.

## Part 1: Human Activity Recognition 

This part of the project focuses on analyzing human activity data collected from smartphone sensors to classify different types of physical activities and predict motion characteristics.

#### Main Goals

1. **Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis**: Clean and analyze the data to uncover initial insights.
2. **Regression Models**: Build models to predict body acceleration.
3. **Classification Models**: Develop models to classify different activity types.
4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply techniques like PCA and evaluate their impact on the data.
5. **Clustering Analysis**: Perform clustering on the activity data using algorithms like K-means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering.

#### Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Create visual representations of sensor data and activity patterns.
- **Regression Modeling**: Implement and evaluate multiple regression algorithms.
- **Multi-class Classification**: Classify activities into different categories.
- **PCA**: Use Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction.
- **Clustering**: Analyze data clusters using various clustering techniques.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using various metrics.

#### Potential Applications

This analysis could be integrated into hiking or tourism apps to:
- Estimate route difficulty based on predicted accelerations.
- Classify types of activities on a route.
- Customize recommendations for users based on fitness levels.

## Part 2: Physical Activity Data Analysis with Neural Networks

This part aims to classify and predict physical activity data collected from smartphone sensors using various neural network architectures. The dataset consists of data from 30 individuals performing different activities, captured using accelerometer and gyroscope sensors.

#### Contents

- `part_2.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project.
- `part_2.pdf`: A PDF version of the code for easy reference.
- `test_csv.zip`: Dataset for the first part of the project (test data).
- `train_csv.zip`: Dataset for the first part of the project (training data).
- `landscape.zip`: Dataset for the second part of the project.

#### Project Structure

The project is divided into several key tasks:

1. **Regression Task**
   - Use the training data to solve a regression problem with neural networks.
   - Explore at least three different neural network architectures.
   - Visualize model architectures.
   - Plot metrics and loss functions over epochs.
   - Select the best model based on performance.
   - Tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance on test data.

2. **Classification Task**
   - Use the training data to solve a classification problem with neural networks.
   - Perform similar steps as in the regression task to explore, visualize, and evaluate different model architectures.

3. **AutoKeras Implementation**
   - Use AutoKeras to automate model selection and hyperparameter tuning for the chosen dataset.
   - Evaluate the performance of the models generated by AutoKeras.

## Data Description

The dataset includes physical activity data from 30 individuals performing various activities while carrying a smartphone on their waist. The smartphone sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) recorded the data, which includes:
- 3-axis linear acceleration (tAcc-XYZ)
- 3-axis angular velocity (tGyro-XYZ)

## About Landscape Dataset

This landscape classification dataset consists of images categorized into five classes, each representing a type of landscape:

- **Coast**: Images of coastal areas and beaches.
- **Desert**: Images of desert regions like the Sahara and Thar.
- **Forest**: Images of forest areas such as the Amazon.
- **Glacier**: Images of glaciers, such as those in Antarctica.
- **Mountains**: Images of mountainous regions like the Himalayas.

The data is organized into three subdirectories for training, validation, and testing. Additionally, there are TensorFlow record directories for each of these subsets, allowing for data loading using either Image Data Generator or TensorFlow records.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LyaSofya/Fundamentals-of-production-technology-and-machine-learning
   ```
2. **Handle the Dataset**: Note that due to GitHub limitations, many files are compressed into archives and split into parts.
3. **Run the Notebooks**:
   Open `part_1.ipynb` and `part_2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to explore and execute the code.
