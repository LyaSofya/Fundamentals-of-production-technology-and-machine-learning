## Project 2 Title: Physical Activity Data Analysis

### Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive project on Physical Activity Data Analysis, located in the `project_2` folder. The project is divided into two main parts: **Physical Activity Recognition** and **Physical Activity Data Analysis with Neural Networks**.

- **Part 1: Human Activity Recognition**: Analyzes human activity data from smartphone sensors to classify different types of physical activities and predict motion characteristics.
- **Part 2: Physical Activity Data Analysis with Neural Networks**: Utilizes various neural network architectures to classify and predict physical activity data, including a task with AutoKeras and a landscape classification dataset.

### Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
- Regression and classification models
- Dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis
- Neural network architectures for regression and classification
- AutoKeras for model optimization

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LyaSofya/Fundamentals-of-production-technology-and-machine-learning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `project_2` folder.
3. Open `part_1.ipynb` and `part_2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab to explore and execute the code.
