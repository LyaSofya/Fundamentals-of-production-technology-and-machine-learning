## Project Title: Video Game Sales Analysis

### Description

This project aims to analyze video game sales data to predict the popularity of games based on various features and user reviews. By employing machine learning techniques, we aim to build models that can predict sales and classify games into categories based on their features.

### Files in the Repository

- **ПР1.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for the project, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of various machine learning models.
- **ПР1.pdf**: A PDF version of the Jupyter Notebook for easy viewing and sharing.
- **Video_Games.csv**: The original dataset containing information about various video games, including their sales figures, genres, platforms, and more.
- **Video_Games_Preprocessed.csv**: The dataset after preprocessing, ready for use in machine learning models.

### Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Removal of duplicates and missing values.
   - Handling outliers and data type conversions.
   - Encoding categorical features and scaling numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualization of data to understand distributions and relationships.
   - Correlation analysis to identify important features.

3. **Regression Tasks**:
   - Selection of target variables related to sales.
   - Implementation and evaluation of at least five regression models.
   - Determination of model performance using at least three metrics.
   - Feature importance analysis and model optimization through hyperparameter tuning.
   - Cross-validation to assess model generalization.

4. **Classification Tasks**:
   - Selection of target variables for classification.
   - Implementation and evaluation of at least five classification models.
   - Determination of model performance using at least four metrics.
   - Model optimization through hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Application of techniques like PCA to reduce feature dimensions.
   - Evaluation of the impact on model performance.

6. **Clustering**:
   - Implementation of at least three clustering algorithms.
   - Evaluation of clustering quality using appropriate metrics.

7. **Model Deployment**:
   - Discussion of potential deployment scenarios for the models.
   - Exploration of how the results can be used to enhance product or service functionalities.
